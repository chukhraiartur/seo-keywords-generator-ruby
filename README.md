This tool uses [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/) as a tool to parse data from Google search results. 

You can use provided API key that will be available after installation, however, it's purely for testing purposes to see if the tool fits your needs. If you'll be using it for your own purpose (personal or commercial), you have to use [your own SerpApi key](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key).


## ‚öôÔ∏èInstallation

```bash
$ gem install seo-keywords-generator-ruby
```


## ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èUsage

#### Available CLI arugments:

```bash
$ seo -h
```

```lang-none
Usage: seo [options]
    -q, --query QUERY                Search query (required)
    -e, --engines ENGINES            Choices of engines to extract: Autocomplete (ac), Related Searches (rs), People Also Ask (rq). You can select multiple engines by separating them with a comma: ac,rs. All engines are selected by default.
    -d, --depth-limit LIMIT          Depth limit for People Also Ask. Default is 0, first 2-4 results.
    -s, --save-to SAVE               Saves the results in the current directory in the selected format (CSV, JSON, TXT). Default CSV.
    -k, --api-key KEY                Your SerpApi API key: https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key. Default is a test API key to test CLI.
    -g, --domain DOMAIN              Google domain: https://serpapi.com/google-domains. Default google.com.
    -c, --country COUNTRY            Country of the search: https://serpapi.com/google-countries. Default us.
    -l, --language LANGUAGE          Language of the search: https://serpapi.com/google-languages. Default en.
```

The `--depth-limit` argument for People Also Ask can be set from `0` to `4`. For each depth limit value, the number of results returned grows exponentially. Below is a table showing how the depth limit argument is affected:

| Depth limit | Number of results | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0 | 4 | Standard results |
| 1 | 12 | 4*2 = 8 + 4 = 12 |
| 2 | 36 | 8*3 = 24 + 12 = 36 |
| 3 | 108 | 24*3 = 72 + 36 = 108 |
| 4 | 324 | 72*3 = 216 + 108 = 324 |

üìåNote: This is how the logic works for the `google.com` domain, on other domains the results may differ.

#### Simple example:

```bash
$ seo -q "starbucks coffee"
```

```json
{
  "auto_complete": [
    "starbucks coffee menu",
    "starbucks coffee sizes",
    "starbucks coffee cups",
    "starbucks coffee gear",
    "starbucks coffee beans",
    "starbucks coffee near me",
    "starbucks coffee drinks",
    "starbucks coffee mugs",
    "starbucks coffee traveler",

    "starbucks coffee flavors"
  ],
  "related_searches": [
    "starbucks near me",
    "starbucks products",
    "amazon starbucks coffee instant",
    "starbucks logo",
    "starbucks drinks",

    "What is the Starbucks drink for St Patrick's Day?",
    "How do I order a regular coffee at Starbucks?",

  ]
}
```

#### Advanced example:

This example will use [related questions API](https://serpapi.com/related-questions) engine with a depth limit value of 2, and saves data to JSON:

```bash
$ seo --api-key "<your_serpapi_api_key>" \
> -q "starbucks coffee" \
> -e rq \
> -d 2 \
> -g google.co.uk \
> -c uk \
> -l en \

```

    "Why is Starbucks famous for?",
    "Is Starbucks coffee good quality coffee?",

    api_key='<your_serpapi_api_key>',
    lang='en',
    country='us',
    domain='google.com'
)

auto_complete_results = keyword_research.get_auto_complete
related_searches_results = keyword_research.get_related_searches
related_questions_results = keyword_research.get_related_questions

data = {
    auto_complete: auto_complete_results,
    related_searches: related_searches_results,
    related_questions: related_questions_results
}

keyword_research.save_to_csv(data)
keyword_research.print_data(data)
```
